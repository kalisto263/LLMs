# ðŸ’« AI at the Frontlines: Practical Applications in Healthcare ðŸ’«

Welcome to this hands-on session â€” we're taking AI into real-world healthcare delivery ðŸš€.  
Instead of just theory, we'll build a prototype conversational bot leveraging UlizaLlama, supporting English & Swahili (and potentially other languages). This bot can be used as a backend for WhatsApp messaging.
